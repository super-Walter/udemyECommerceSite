(Depolyed Site)[https://walters-shop.herokuapp.com/]

## E-Commerce Shop

This is a web application where users can browse merchandise and add them to shopping cart.

## Motivation

This web application was my first React.js framework website.
I think it's a good method to train my skills of React eco-system.
